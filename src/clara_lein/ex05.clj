;;;; THE CONSTRAINTS IN PLAIN ENGLISH            
;;;;        Of Landon and Jason, one has the 7:30pm reservation and the other loves mozzarella.
;;;;        The blue cheese enthusiast subscribed to Fortune.
;;;;        The muenster enthusiast didn't subscribe to Vogue.
;;;;        The 5 people were the Fortune subscriber, Landon, the person with a reservation at 5:00pm, the mascarpone enthusiast, and the Vogue subscriber.
;;;;        The person with a reservation at 5:00pm didn't subscribe to Time.
;;;;        The Cosmopolitan subscriber has an earlier reservation than the mascarpone enthusiast.
;;;;        Bailey has a later reservation than the blue cheese enthusiast.
;;;;        Either the person with a reservation at 7:00pm or the person with a reservation at 7:30pm subscribed to Fortune.
;;;;        Landon has a later reservation than the Time subscriber.
;;;;        The Fortune subscriber is not Jamari.
;;;;        The person with a reservation at 5:00pm loves mozzarella.
;;;; 
;;;; The main strategy to this is:
;;;;
;;;; - Track a candidate configuration as a record, which is essentially a map.
;;;;
;;;;     The map fields are:
;;;;       id: a numeric id that labels a configuration candidate.
;;;;       fortune time cosmopolitan us-weekly vogue: the magazines
;;;;       asiago blue-cheese mascarpone mozzarella muenster: the cheeses
;;;;       five six seven seven-thirty eight-thirty: the reservation times.
;;;;     The map values are the people:
;;;;       amaya bailey jamari jason landon
;;;;     
;;;;     Each candidate has an id and a permutation of the people assigned to
;;;;     the field groups:
;;;;       magazine, cheese, and reservation time.
;;;;
;;;;  An example candidate is:
;;;; #clara_lein.ex05.Candidate{:id 0,
;;;;    :fortune :amaya, :time :bailey, :cosmopolitan :jamari, :us-weekly :jason, :vogue :landon,
;;;;    :asiago :amaya, :blue-cheese :bailey, :mascarpone :jamari, :mozzarella :jason, :muenster :landon,
;;;;    :five :amaya, :six :bailey, :seven :jamari, :seven-thirty :jason, :eight-thirty :landon}
;;;;
;;;; Note how each line for magazine, cheese, and time has a permutation of the people.
;;;;
 


;;;; Symbols that will be used
;;;; Have: people, magazines, cheeses, and reservation times
(def people
  '(amaya bailey jamari jason landon))

(def mag-syms
  '(fortune time cosmopolitan us-weekly vogue))

(def cheese-syms
  '(asiago blue-cheese mascarpone mozzarella muenster))

(def time-syms
  '(five six seven seven-thirty eight-thirty))






;;; This constructs a record that has all of the symbols, plus an `id` field
;;; that has a unique identifying number.
;;;
;;; Use quoting and evaluation to save typing and use the syms definitions to get the record.
